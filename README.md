# ShowTime

## Description 
This application provides users a website to search information on TV Shows. APIs used include TVMaze and WatchMode. The website contains a data base of TV shows and their information, as well as streaming mediums for each show. Links of well-known external websites such as Netflix, Disney etc... that provide a wider variety of TV shows and movie content are also provided at the bottom. 

## Usage
Open https://agrastp.github.io/SHOWtime_Website/ with your browser to load the website. You can input a show's title according to preference and click on search button. The most related results with their information such as genre, language, network and summary will be shown. When a TV show you look for is not contained in the database, no result will be shown. Under "Watch it here", users can look for streaming services and channels to watch the show. Search history will be displayed on the page after users click search.
